The codes presented in this link support the thesis delivered on July 5, 2018 
to the Department of Mathematics of the University of Coimbra under the title: 
"Computational methods for beam angle optimization in intensity modulated  
radiotherapy". 

These codes supported the computational results presented in Chapter 5 and are 
divided into 3 different folders, referring to the 3 computational experiments 
performed. The user must have the software Matlab and CPLEX.

In order to execute these codes properly, he user must have the software Matlab 
and cplex. The codes should be downloaded and later performed in the matlab 
software, through 'main.m'. However, in order to run 'Experiment 2' or 
'Experiment 3', the codes should be downloaded and added or replaced (if they 
have the same name) to the files in the 'Experiment 1'.
