### IMRT-Project

The present work deals with an optimization problem related to the treatment of tumor forms, known as intensity modulated radiotherapy. This treatment method is based on the incidence of X-ray radiation, which aims to destroy malignant cells, whilst preserving, as far as possible, the surrounding vital organs. This text reviews this type of treatment and its planning with the goal of making its application effective.

The codes presented in this link support the thesis delivered on July 5, 2018 
to the Department of Mathematics of the University of Coimbra under the title: 
"Computational methods for beam angle optimization in intensity modulated  
radiotherapy". 

These codes supported the computational results presented in Chapter 5 and are 
divided into 3 different folders, referring to the 3 computational experiments 
performed. The user must have the software Matlab and CPLEX.

In order to execute these codes properly, he user must have the software Matlab 
and cplex. The codes should be downloaded and later performed in the matlab 
software, through 'main.m'. However, in order to run 'Experiment 2' or 
'Experiment 3', the codes should be downloaded and added or replaced (if they 
have the same name) to the files in the 'Experiment 1'.
